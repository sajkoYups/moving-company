    "q2": "How fast do you reply?",
    "a2": "We get back to you within 24 hours of your request. Most inquiries receive a response the same day during business hours.",
    "q3": "What happens after I submit the form?",
    "a3": "After you submit the form, we call or email you within 24 hours to arrange a free on-site visit. During the visit, we assess your move requirements and provide a final quote. You receive the final quote after the visit.",
    "q4": "What does assembly and disassembly include?",
    "a4": "Assembly and disassembly includes kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, beds, washing machines, and similar furniture items. The exact scope is agreed during the on-site visit when we can see what needs to be taken apart and reassembled.",
    "q5": "How does disposal (Sperrmüll) work?",
    "a5": "We discuss disposal needs during the on-site visit and provide a separate cost estimate for bulky waste removal. Disposal costs depend on the volume and type of items you need removed.",
    "q6": "Do you do weekend moves?",
    "a6": "Yes, we are available Monday through Saturday by appointment. Weekend availability depends on our schedule, so we recommend booking early.",
    "q7": "How do you handle parking and access?",
    "a7": "During the on-site visit, we clarify parking options and building access details including elevator availability and floor numbers. This ensures move day runs smoothly without delays.",
    "q8": "Are prices including VAT?",
    "a8": "Yes. All prices include VAT and are indicative until after the on-site visit. The final price confirmed after the visit also includes VAT."
